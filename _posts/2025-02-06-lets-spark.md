"Quem está vivo sempre aparece!" means literally "Who is alive always shows up!".

This is a brazilian saying meaning "Long time no see!" and think it is beautiful. Anyways... After 1+ year away, here I am again. 

NO ONE can blame me though, as I said from the very beginning: I don't really know how to blog.

The reason for this humble return is simple: I need to MASTER Spark, you see. Not just learn it, but trully MASTER it and be the best. As of [Let's talk like a pro](https://olimaandreza.github.io/2023/07/23/lets-talk-like-pro.html) post, I'm still improving my data engineering skills. Now, the focus is on better understanding how the Spark engine works and diving deeper into the use of PySpark.

Today's post is just to announce that I'm back in a Data Engineer Bootcamp, and I'm tired of not fully grasping Spark. Since writing is the best way for me to learn, I've decided to return to this blog.

So, here we go. Let's see how this journey unfolds.
